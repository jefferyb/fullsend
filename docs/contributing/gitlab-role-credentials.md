title: GitLab Role-Credential Contract

# GitLab Role-Credential Contract

This is the internal contract for GitLab responsibility identities:
built-in **Poller**, **Analyst**, and **Coder**, plus optional
administrator-registered **custom roles**. It implements
[#7497](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7497) under the
three-role decision in [#7424](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7424)
and parent [#7496](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7496).

The Go package is [`internal/gitlabroles`](../../internal/gitlabroles/).
Provisioning of built-in and custom role credentials is implemented by
`repos install` (`internal/repos` / `internal/cli`). Routing of jobs and
forge operations by registered role is implemented by `fullsend poll`,
`fullsend run`, and `fullsend post-review`. Rotation, recovery, and
in-flight overlap are implemented by `RotateGitLabRoleCredentials`
(`internal/repos`) and invoked from `repos install`. Shared-token
retirement remains a follow-up issue. Both rotation and retirement must
follow the [credential-routing security checklist](#credential-routing-security-checklist).

Built-in and custom roles are the same kind of registry entry. Job
credential selection walks that registry; it does not switch on a
three-role enum.

**Disabled-mode runtime is unchanged.** When the migration gate is unset
or `disabled` (and on explicit `rollback`), jobs continue to authenticate
with the shared `FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN` project access token described in
[ADR 0067](../ADRs/0067-gitlab-cron-polling-event-dispatch.md). When the
gate is `migrating` or `enforced`, `fullsend poll` and `fullsend run`
select the registered role credential via `gitlabroles.Select` /
`SelectAgent`. Custom roles are not required on existing installations.

## Registered roles

A **registered role** is an allowlisted GitLab responsibility identity.
It has:

- A stable name (`poller`, `analyst`, `coder`, or an administrator-
  chosen custom name).
- A kind: `builtin` or `custom`.
- Responsibility metadata (what the identity is for).
- A credential **reference** (own secret, or reuse of another
  registered role's secret). The registry never stores token values.
- Capability flags used for validation (not GitLab ACL grants).
- Agent / harness-role names that map onto it.

GitLab project-token scopes cannot express endpoint-level least
privilege; separate credentials give distinct audit identities, keep
Analyst eligible for native MR approval when Coder committed, and limit
the blast radius of a single compromise.

### Built-in roles

These three are always in the registry. Existing installations do not
need to declare them.

| Role | Responsibility | Must not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Poller** | Event/issue reads, pipeline dispatch, poll-state writes on `fullsend-poll-state-slash` and `fullsend-poll-state-events` | Modify application code or act as the Analyst approval identity |
| **Analyst** | Review, triage, prioritization, retrospectives, issue/reporting, notes, labels | Modify repository code or poll-state branches |
| **Coder** | Repository writes, code/fix work, merge-request creation and updates | Be used as the Analyst approval identity |

Stable Go names: `poller`, `analyst`, `coder`
(`gitlabroles.RolePoller` / `RoleAnalyst` / `RoleCoder`).

### Custom roles

An administrator may register additional roles. A custom role is a
first-class registry entry: the same `Resolve` path, the same
unconfigured / unregistered / auth-failed distinction, and the same
migration gate as the built-ins.

Custom roles are optional. An empty registry variable means built-ins
only.

## Trusted registry

The registry is installation state, not repository content.

| Source | Allowed? |
| --- | --- |
| Built-in table in `internal/gitlabroles` | Yes (always present) |
| Protected CI/CD variable `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_REGISTRY` | Yes (administrator-controlled JSON) |
| `.fullsend/config.yaml`, harness files, merge-request diffs, issue bodies | **No.** These may *reference* a registered name (for example a harness `role:` field). They must not create, rename, or elevate a role. |

`gitlabroles.LoadRegistry` / `ParseRegistry` are the only constructors
for custom roles. The JSON decoder rejects unknown fields, so a leaked
token cannot hide under a key such as `token`. `secret_name` must be a
CI/CD variable name (`FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_SCANNER_TOKEN`); values that
look like GitLab PATs (`glpat-…`) are rejected.

A custom role cannot:

- Reuse a built-in name (`poller`, `analyst`, `coder`).
- Steal a built-in agent mapping (`review`, `code`, `fix`, …).
- Point `reuse` at an unregistered name or create a reuse cycle.
- Declare an unknown capability.

Harness `role:` and custom-agent names are validated with
`Registry.ValidateAgent`. An unregistered name returns
`ErrUnregistered`. `fullsend poll` / `fullsend run` call that check at
dispatch time when the gate is `migrating` or `enforced`; this contract
defines the check.

## Credential references

Each registration names how the role authenticates. The registry stores
**references and policy**, never raw secret values.

| `credential` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `own` (default) | The role has its own masked CI/CD variable. Built-in names are listed below. Custom names derive `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_<NAME>_TOKEN` (hyphens become underscores). |
| `reuse` | The role shares another **registered** role's credential. `reuse` is the target role name. Presence and rotation follow the target. |

Reuse is how a custom agent can share Coder (or another role) without
minting a second PAT. It is not a silent fallback: the job still
selects that role's identity, and a runtime auth failure of the shared
secret still fails closed.

## Capabilities

Capabilities are contract metadata for validation. Every role token is
still GitLab Developer (30) with the `api` scope; do not document these
flags as least-privilege API grants.

| Capability | Typical holder |
| --- | --- |
| `read_issues` | Poller, Analyst, Coder |
| `write_issues`, `write_notes`, `write_labels` | Analyst |
| `approve_merge_request` | Analyst |
| `dispatch_pipeline`, `write_poll_state` | Poller |
| `write_repository`, `write_merge_request` | Coder |

`Registration.Has` is the check routing uses so Analyst cannot perform
code writes through the normal role configuration, a Coder job cannot
approve a merge request, and a custom role cannot exceed the
capabilities the administrator declared.

## Identifiers

### CI/CD variables

Role tokens are **masked, protected** project CI/CD variables, same
storage as today's shared bot PAT. The migration gate and the registry
document are **protected and unmasked** so status and logs can print
mode and policy without exposing secrets.

| Name | Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN` | masked secret | Shared bot PAT. Unchanged default path. |
| `FULLSEND_GITLAB_POLLER_TOKEN` | masked secret | Poller PAT. Provisioned by `repos install`; optional on existing installs until migration. |
| `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ANALYST_TOKEN` | masked secret | Analyst PAT. Provisioned by `repos install`; optional on existing installs until migration. |
| `FULLSEND_GITLAB_CODER_TOKEN` | masked secret | Coder PAT. Provisioned by `repos install`; optional on existing installs until migration. |
| `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_<NAME>_TOKEN` | masked secret | Custom role PAT when `credential` is `own`. Provisioned when the role is registered. |
| `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_MIGRATION` | unmasked variable | Feature gate. Absent or empty = `disabled`. |
| `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_REGISTRY` | unmasked variable | Administrator registry JSON. Absent or empty = built-ins only. |
| `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_ROTATION` | unmasked variable | Per-role rotation state (lock, token IDs, expiry dates, phase). Never stores token values. |

Canonical constants live in [`internal/forge/forge.go`](../../internal/forge/forge.go)
(`SecretForgeToken`, `SecretGitLabPollerToken`,
`SecretGitLabAnalystToken`, `SecretGitLabCoderToken`,
`VarGitLabRoleMigration`, `VarGitLabRoleRegistry`,
`VarGitLabRoleRotation`). Custom secret names
are derived by `gitlabroles.CustomSecretName`.

Role secrets and the registry **must not** be added to
`requiredSecretsForForge` while the gate is disabled. Existing
installations would otherwise fail health checks for secrets they do
not have.

### Project access token names

| Role | PAT name | Access | Scopes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared (today) | `fullsend-bot` | Developer (30) | `api` |
| Poller | `fullsend-poller` | Developer (30) | `api` |
| Analyst | `fullsend-analyst` | Developer (30) | `api` |
| Coder | `fullsend-coder` | Developer (30) | `api` |
| Custom `own` | `fullsend-role-<name>` | Developer (30) | `api` |
| Custom `reuse` | (none; uses the target role's PAT) | — | — |

`repos install` creates these tokens on a fresh GitLab install and on
an existing install that opts into `--gitlab-role-migration=migrating`
(or already has a `migrating`/`enforced` gate). It does not revoke the
shared `fullsend-bot` token. Access level and scopes match the current
shared bot; do not claim finer GitLab permissions than the
implementation uses.

## Job → role mapping

| Job | Role |
| --- | --- |
| GitLab poller/controller (`fullsend poll`, `fullsend-poll.yml`) | Poller |
| Agents / harness roles `review`, `triage`, `prioritize`, `retro`, `scribe` | Analyst |
| Agents / harness roles `code`, `fix`, `coder` | Coder |
| Custom agent whose name or harness `role:` is listed on a registered custom role | That custom role |

`Registry.RoleFor` accepts either an agent name or a harness `role:`
value. Built-in aliases and custom agent names share this lookup.

Unmapped jobs (for example `e2e` or an unregistered custom agent) keep
working on the shared token when the gate is `disabled` or `rollback`.
In `migrating` and `enforced` they fail closed (`ErrUnregistered`)
rather than guessing an identity. `ValidateAgent` itself takes no mode
and always rejects an unmapped name, so `Select` / `SelectAgent` only
call it as a pre-check ahead of `Resolve` when the migration gate is
`migrating` or `enforced`; calling it unconditionally ahead of the
legacy `disabled`/`rollback` path would break existing installations
that rely on unmapped jobs falling back to the shared token.

## Migration gate

`FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_MIGRATION` is the only switch that changes
credential selection. Values are case-insensitive; unknown values fail
closed (`ErrInvalidMode`) so a typo cannot silently disable the gate.

| Mode | When | Shared token used | Missing role secret |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `disabled` (default, unset) | Existing installations | Always | Ignored |
| `migrating` | Additive rollout after #7498 | Only as **explicit** fallback when that role is unconfigured | Use shared token; report pending |
| `rollback` | Operator-initiated rollback | Always | Ignored (role secrets unused) |
| `enforced` | After verification (#7501) | Never | Fail (`ErrUnconfigured`) |

The shared token is **not** selected after an arbitrary
role-credential failure. The only legitimate shared-token uses are:

1. `disabled` (legacy path)
2. `rollback` (explicit operator action)
3. `migrating` **and** the role secret is absent/empty (not yet provisioned)

An unregistered name is never a reason to use the shared token in a
role-aware mode.

## How a job selects its credential

Call `gitlabroles.Select` (poller) or `gitlabroles.SelectAgent` (agent
jobs). Those helpers load the gate, registry, and presence map, call
`ValidateAgent` in `migrating`/`enforced`, then `Resolve`:

- `Mode` from `gitlabroles.ModeFrom` (the gate variable)
- `Job` (`PollerJob()` or `AgentJob(name)`)
- `Registry` from `LoadRegistry` (zero value = built-ins only)
- `Present`: a boolean map of whether each secret *name* is non-empty
  (`PresenceFrom`). **Never put token values in this map.**

`Select` and `SelectAgent` never set `FailedSecret` on the `Request` they
build — it stays at its zero value. `FailedSecret` only matters when a
caller constructs a `Request` directly and calls `Resolve` after an
authentication failure. `fullsend poll`'s `wrapGitLabAuthFailure` uses the
`AuthFailed` helper for this instead of re-resolving: on a 401/403, it
wraps the error with `gitlabroles.AuthFailed(role, mode, secret)` rather
than calling `Select`/`SelectAgent`/`Resolve` again for that job. Per
`AuthFailed`'s doc comment, callers must fail closed on an authentication
failure, not re-Select with a different job or a cleared `FailedSecret`.

The result is a `Source` whose `SecretName` is the CI/CD variable to
read. Callers then `os.Getenv(src.SecretName)`. Built-in and custom
roles return through this same function.

`fullsend poll` selects the Poller credential. `fullsend run` selects
the agent identity (agent name, or harness `role:` if the agent name is
unlisted), exports `GITLAB_TOKEN` from that secret, and sets
`PUSH_TOKEN` only when the registration declares `write_repository`.
`fullsend post-review` refuses GitLab `APPROVE` when the identity lacks
`approve_merge_request`. Role-aware modes also publish non-secret
diagnostic env vars `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE`,
`FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_SECRET`, and `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_SOURCE`.
GitLab CI templates still read `FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN` for bootstrap API
calls; the Go CLI overrides the token used for forge operations.

## Unconfigured vs unregistered vs failed

These are different errors. Do not collapse them.

| Situation | Sentinel | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role name is not in the registry | `ErrUnregistered` | Custom agent referenced an unknown identity |
| Role secret absent or empty | `ErrUnconfigured` | Registered, not provisioned yet |
| Shared secret absent in `disabled`/`rollback` | `ErrSharedUnconfigured` | Legacy path broken |
| Runtime 401/403 (or equivalent) from a selected credential | `ErrAuthFailed` | Credential is present but unusable |
| Job kind is empty or unrecognized | `ErrUnknownJob` | No identity to select |
| Gate value is not a known mode | `ErrInvalidMode` | Fail closed |
| Registry JSON is malformed or untrusted | `ErrInvalidRegistry` | Fail closed; do not load custom roles |

In `migrating`, a registered role whose secret is absent but whose
shared token is present is **not** `ErrUnconfigured` — `Resolve`
returns a successful `Source` with `Fallback` set (explicit migration
fallback). `ErrUnconfigured` in `migrating` means both the role secret
and the shared token are absent. `ErrUnregistered` and `ErrAuthFailed`
never fall back to the shared token in any mode.

## No silent fallback on authentication failure

If a selected credential fails authentication or authorization, the job
fails. It does **not** retry as another identity, including the shared
bot.

`Resolve` enforces this when `FailedSecret` is set: it returns
`ErrAuthFailed` in every mode and returns a zero `Source`. Callers that
observe an auth failure must either pass that secret name back into
`Resolve` or stop; they must not call `Resolve` again with a different
job or a cleared `FailedSecret` in order to pick a substitute.

## Status, drift, and diagnostics

`gitlabroles.Diagnose(mode, present, registry)` is the observable
report:

- Per-role state: `configured` or `unconfigured` (presence only),
  including custom roles and reuse targets
- `Partial`: some but not all registered role secrets exist
- `Ready`:
  - `disabled` / `rollback`: shared token present
  - `migrating` / `enforced`: every registered role's credential is present
- `Missing`: registered roles whose secrets are absent
- `Diagnostics`: human-readable lines with **names only**

Classification of a missing role secret:

- `disabled` / `rollback`: not required (not drift)
- `migrating`: pending (informational; expected during rollout)
- `enforced`: missing/required (drift / fail closed)

A role secret that is present while the gate is `disabled` or
`rollback` is reported as "configured but unused". That is not an
error; leftover secrets after rollback are expected until uninstall
removes them. `repos install --rotate-gitlab-roles` refreshes those
leftover secrets without changing the gate; it does not remove them.

**Never** put token values in logs, status output, issue comments, or
`Error` strings. Presence booleans and variable names are the only
safe signals.

`repos status` reports per-role diagnostics (names only). Missing role
secrets are not health drift while the gate is `disabled` or
`migrating`; they are drift when the gate is `enforced`. Converge
health checks stay on the shared-token required set so a partial
migration cannot fail an otherwise healthy install.

## Registry JSON shape

`FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_REGISTRY` (protected, unmasked):

```json
{
  "roles": [
    {
      "name": "scanner",
      "responsibility": "read-only scanning",
      "credential": "own",
      "capabilities": ["read_issues", "write_notes"],
      "agents": ["scanner"]
    },
    {
      "name": "deployer",
      "credential": "reuse",
      "reuse": "coder",
      "capabilities": ["write_repository", "write_merge_request"],
      "agents": ["deploy"]
    }
  ]
}
```

`name` must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$` with no double hyphen, the same
rule as mint role names. `secret_name` is optional on `own` and must
equal the derived `FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE_<NAME>_TOKEN` when set.

`repos install --gitlab-role-registry` writes this variable.
Agents and repository files do not.

## Rotation and recovery

GitLab project access tokens expire in at most one year. Fullsend
rotates each own-credential registered role independently — built-in
Poller, Analyst, and Coder, and custom `own` roles. A `reuse` role
follows its target; it is not minted a second time.

`repos install` rotates a role when `DiagnoseLifecycle` reports it as
expiring (within 30 days), expired, revoked, or unverified (secret
present but no matching project access token), and the gate is
`migrating` or `enforced`. `--rotate-gitlab-roles` force-rotates every
own-credential role. `--rotate-gitlab-role=<name>` limits the run to
that role (repeatable). `--rotate-gitlab-roles` on `disabled` or
`rollback` refreshes leftover role secrets without changing the gate.

**Create-then-distribute, not GitLab's rotate-in-place API.** GitLab's
token-rotate endpoint invalidates the previous secret immediately.
Fullsend creates a new PAT with the same token name, writes it to the
existing masked CI variable, and leaves the previous PAT active for a
24-hour grace so jobs that already hold the old value in their
environment can finish. A later `repos install` after the grace period
revokes the outgoing PAT. New jobs started after distribution read the
replacement from CI.

**Failed rotation does not strand a role.** If creation fails, nothing
is written. If distribution fails, only the unused replacement PAT is
revoked and the previous CI secret is left in place. Concurrent
attempts for the same role are serialized (in-process lock plus a
protected rotation-state document) and idempotent within a five-minute
window: a retry adopts the already-distributed replacement rather than
minting another. A crash after create where distribution is unproven
(state stuck at `distributing`/`failed` with an incoming ID) is
recovered by treating that incoming PAT as possibly the live CI
secret: it is never revoked immediately, but kept in the outgoing set,
the phase is marked `failed`, and a fresh replacement is minted and
distributed. The preserved token is revoked only after the normal
24-hour grace, once the new replacement is confirmed distributed.

**No silent shared-token fallback.** Rotation never writes
`FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN` and never selects the shared credential because
a role rotation failed. The shared token remains available only through
the explicit migration/rollback gate. Runtime 401/403 of a selected
role credential is still `ErrAuthFailed`.

**Administrator-provided replacement does not auto-revoke leftovers.**
`--gitlab-role-token` (free-tier enrollment or a custom `own`
credential) stores the supplied value directly. Its own GitLab token ID
cannot be resolved from the value alone, so it cannot be excluded from
the same-named project access tokens GitLab already lists — recording
all of them for grace revocation risks revoking the just-enrolled
replacement itself. Enrolling a replacement this way therefore does not
schedule any other active same-named PAT for revocation; if one exists,
confirm it is not the replacement and revoke it manually.

**Identity continuity.** GitLab assigns a new bot user per PAT, so the
GitLab user ID changes on replacement. Fullsend preserves the role
name, token name (`fullsend-poller`, `fullsend-role-<name>`), CI
variable, and capability set. Rotation state records the old and new
token IDs (never secret values) for internal use by
`RotateGitLabRoleCredentials`: serialization between runs, crash
recovery, and grace-period revocation tracking during `repos install`.
It is not read or displayed by `repos status`.

**Diagnostics.** `DiagnoseLifecycle` classifies each role as `ok`,
`expiring`, `expired`, `revoked`, `unverified`, `overlapping`, or
`unconfigured`. `repos status` reports those names and, in `enforced`
mode, treats expired and revoked credentials as drift. Lines carry role
names, secret names, and dates only.

## What this contract does not do

Leave these to the follow-up issues.

| Issue | Work |
| --- | --- |
| [#7498](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7498) | **Implemented.** `repos install` creates/enrolls built-in and custom PATs, stores them as protected masked CI variables, writes the registry, sets the gate, reports partial provisioning, preserves the shared token, and handles reinstall/drift/uninstall without deleting credentials still in use |
| [#7499](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7499) | **Implemented.** `fullsend poll`, `fullsend run`, and `fullsend post-review` select the registered role credential, enforce `ValidateAgent` / `Registration.Has` in role-aware modes, and fail closed on authentication failure without switching identities |
| [#7500](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7500) | **Implemented.** Role-aware rotation, recovery, in-flight overlap, and expiry/revocation diagnostics. See [Rotation and recovery](#rotation-and-recovery) and follow the [credential-routing security checklist](#credential-routing-security-checklist) |
| [#7501](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7501) | Verification, enable `enforced`, retire the shared token. Hold the [credential-routing security checklist](#credential-routing-security-checklist) |
| [#7502](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7502) | ADR 0067 status annotation and operator-facing lifecycle docs |

## Credential-routing security checklist

Hold these four invariants when changing `internal/gitlabroles`, GitLab
credential handling in `internal/cli`, or the remaining rollout stage
([#7501](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/7501)). They are
the review findings from [PR #7510](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/pull/7510)
(stage 3 routing). A later change that selects, stores, or hands a
GitLab role credential to a child process can reintroduce any of them.
Extend the helpers named below rather than adding a parallel path.

### Check the authenticating token, not a role label

Capability and permission checks must validate the **token that will
actually authenticate the call**, not a role-label env var
(`FULLSEND_GITLAB_ROLE`, `STAGE`, or equivalent). Labels select a
registration; they can diverge from the credential (for example
`--token` pointing at a different role's secret). Compare the
authenticating token against `getenv(sel.Source.SecretName)` before
trusting `gitlabroles.Require`. A mismatch fails closed with
`gitlabroles.ErrIdentityMismatch`. See `checkGitLabApprovalCapability`
in `internal/cli/gitlab_role.go`.

- [ ] New capability checks compare the authenticating token to the
      selected role's own secret value.
- [ ] A label/token mismatch fails closed; it does not check the wrong
      identity's capabilities.

### Blank sibling role secrets after selection

After selecting a credential, blank every other registered role secret
(and the shared `FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN`) from the process environment
**before** invoking a pre/post-script. Host-side scripts inherit the
whole process environment via `childScriptEnv`. A leftover
`FULLSEND_GITLAB_ANALYST_TOKEN` in a Coder job lets a script
authenticate as Analyst and bypass in-process checks such as
`checkGitLabApprovalCapability`. See `clearSiblingGitLabRoleSecrets` /
`applyGitLabRoleSelection`.

- [ ] Selection blanks sibling role secrets and the unused shared token
      in role-aware modes.
- [ ] New rotation or recovery paths that write a replacement secret do
      not leave the previous or sibling raw value in the process
      environment of a subsequent child.

### Pin routing env vars against runner_env override

`GITLAB_TOKEN`, `FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN`, and every `FULLSEND_GITLAB_*`
var must be pinned to the process environment when building a
child-script env. A harness `runner_env` / `env.runner` entry must not
shadow the dispatch-selected identity. `childScriptEnv` drops those
keys from `runnerEnv` via `isPinnedGitLabRoleRoutingKey`.

`PUSH_TOKEN` is **not** pinned: the GitHub coder-remint path
(`syncRunnerEnvTokens`, #7231) relies on `runner_env` overriding a
stale process-env `PUSH_TOKEN`, and GitLab never writes `PUSH_TOKEN`
through that path. Do not pin `PUSH_TOKEN` to "close the set" — that
reintroduces #7231 for GitHub runs.

- [ ] New GitLab identity or credential env vars are covered by
      `isPinnedGitLabRoleRoutingKey` (or an equivalent pin).
- [ ] `PUSH_TOKEN` stays unpinned unless the GitHub remint path is
      redesigned in the same change.

### Preserve non-role-aware token fallbacks

Do not break the documented local-run workflow unless the change is
explicitly breaking (`!` suffix and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` trailer per
[COMMITS.md](../../COMMITS.md)). In `disabled` / `rollback`
(`UsesSharedOnly`), `fullsend run --forge gitlab` falls back to a no-op
when the only error is `gitlabroles.ErrSharedUnconfigured`, so a
directly-set `GITLAB_TOKEN` (no `FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN`) still works.
Role-aware modes (`migrating` / `enforced`) still fail closed.

Retiring the **shared-token** fallback is the point of #7501 and must
be an explicit, flagged cutover after verification — not a silent
tightening of `disabled`/`rollback` or of the local `GITLAB_TOKEN`
fallback.

- [ ] `disabled`/`rollback` still accept a directly-set `GITLAB_TOKEN`
      when `FULLSEND_FORGE_TOKEN` is absent, unless this change is
      marked breaking.
- [ ] Shared-token fallback is removed only in the #7501 cutover, after
      role checks pass, and is marked `!`.

## Security notes

- Threat priority remains external injection > insider > drift >
  supply chain. Separate identities reduce insider/compromise blast
  radius; they do not replace protected-variable and protected-branch
  controls from ADR 0067.
- Role registration is administrator-controlled installation state.
  Arbitrary repository or pull-request content cannot create or elevate
  a role.
- All role secrets stay protected and masked. The gate and registry
  variables are protected so only protected-branch pipelines observe a
  mode or policy change.
- GitLab `Developer` + `api` is still coarse. Do not document these
  tokens as least-privilege API grants.
- `CI_DEBUG_TRACE` remains forbidden on jobs that hold any of these
  variables.
- When changing credential routing, rotation, or cutover, follow the
  [credential-routing security checklist](#credential-routing-security-checklist).
